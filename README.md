# Processing of time series

This _repo_ contains a variety of subroutines for the analysis of time series typically found in civil engineering such
ground motion displacement, velocity and accelaration. Subroutines useful in the computation of Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS), 
Response Spectra (RS)and Transfer Functions (TF) are provided.

The _repo_ contains 3 main folders:

1. `DATOS/` The signals to be processed must be stored in this folder.

2. `FUENTE/` Stores the actual subroutines.

3. `RESULTADOS/` Stores the output.
